# JavaScript Foundations

This repository documents my daily progress while learning JavaScript fundamentals through FreeCodeCamp and other practical resources.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation in programming before moving into Solidity and smart contract development.

## About This Repository

I’m using this space to track what I learn each day, write small code examples, and keep notes that will help me understand JavaScript deeply.  
All code here is written by me while completing exercises, experimenting, and building small projects.

## My Learning Goals
- Build a clear understanding of JavaScript syntax and logic.  
- Learn how to work with variables, functions, arrays, and objects.  
- Write simple projects using DOM manipulation and events.  
- Prepare for Solidity smart contract development.

## Daily Progress (short summary)

**Oct 25–26, 2025**  
I completed my first two days of FreeCodeCamp’s Basic JavaScript section.  
Learned how variables work, practiced assignment and arithmetic operators, and worked with simple string concatenations.  
Also practiced using `console.log()` to print and debug code.
